# MultiClock
This tool is a simplified version of a multi-location clock, which is used by interplanet travellers.

## Prerequisite
1. Installed Python version >= 3.8 

## Get started
First download files in the repository:

````bash
git clone https://github.com/Shuai-Zhang16/Multi-location-clock.git
````

Then run the following code in the downloaded folder to start GUI: 

````bash
python3 multiclock.py
````

## Motivation
This project is inspired by the novel "The Lathe of Heaven" written by Ursula K. LeGuin. The concept of a multiverse leads to our thinking that how time could differ in different realities and environments?  

By taking the first step to address a practical issue faced by cosmic travelers: how to accurately measure and display time on different planets within our solar system? We could have a better understanding of the complexity of time and space.

## Potential Issues
Currently, time on each planet is calculated based on Earth's current time. 
However, due to the time it takes for signals, in the form of light, to travel from Earth to other planets, there may be inaccuracies during the synchronization process. This phenomenon is known as "time dilation."
 
In the future, this problem might be solved with the advancement of technology, such as the development of quantum communication or the establishment of a more accurate time synchronization system.
